# Ruby Homework 4 - Gym
=begin
A gym has hired you to solve a problem. Most of their clients are fairly new to weightlifting and donâ€™t know what to put on the barbell for a particular weight. The weights they have made available are in 45, 35, 25, 15, 10 and 5 lbs. increments. Build them a Ruby application that will tell them, for a given weight, what plates to put on each side of the bar. Bear in mind that the bar itself weighs 45 lbs.

For example, if they want to load 225 lbs. on the bar, they will need to put two 45 lbs. plates on each side of the bar. 45x4 = 180 lbs. Plus 45 lbs. for the barbell itself equals a total of 225 lbs. 

Hint: You don't really need to create Objects for this one, so you get a break from that. But you will need to create methods!
